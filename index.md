SentinelOne is sending a squadron of their finest experts to share their knowledge on the elusive art of MITRE deception.

As a pioneering force in this field, they will be providing not only a delectable BBQ DINNER catered by Edmonton's local CORNERSTONE BBQ, but also valuable insights on how to outsmart the crafty attackers. Think of it as a masterclass on the tactics and strategies needed to protect your organization from cyber-attacks.

In the words of the renowned ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu, "All warfare is based on deception." And just as Sun Tzu believed in the importance of deception in warfare, Sentinel One understands the significance of deception in the ever-evolving battlefield of cybersecurity. So, join us for this informative session, and let's learn how to effectively deploy deception techniques to turn the tables on attackers.
