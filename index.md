Join us for our monthly OWASP event where we will dive deep into Docker Security and the OWASP Top Ten for Docker. This month's event will focus on privilege escalation attacks from the HOST, a critical issue that every Docker user must be aware of.

Our event sponsor is iON United, a trusted cybersecurity solution provider for IT, OT, and cloud environments within Canada.
They be providing delicious pizza for all attendees, so come hungry and ready to learn!

Our guest speaker for this event is John, an experienced security professional who has worked for Fortune 500 companies. With his extensive knowledge and expertise in Docker security, John will provide valuable insights and practical tips to help you secure your Docker environment.

As Socrates once said, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." Don't miss this opportunity to expand your knowledge and learn how to protect your Docker environment from privilege escalation attacks.

We look forward to seeing you there!
